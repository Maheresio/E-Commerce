## Overview

The **"See All"** and **"Filter"** features are core components of the shop and common modules, enabling users to efficiently browse, discover, and refine product listings. These features are designed for scalability, performance, and a seamless user experience across both grid and list layouts.

---

## Feature Purpose

- **See All:**  
  Allows users to view the complete set of products or items in a category, collection, or search result, beyond the initial preview or limited set.
- **Filter:**  
  Empowers users to narrow down product lists based on attributes such as price, brand, rating, category, availability, and custom tags.

```

### Design Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  UI, business logic, and data access are separated for maintainability.
- **Provider/BLoC:**  
  State management is handled via Provider or BLoC, ensuring reactive updates.
- **Reusable Widgets:**  
  `SeeAllButton`, `FilterButton`, and `FilterSheet` are reusable across modules.

---

## UI/UX Flow

### See All

1. **Entry Point:**  
   - Appears as a button or link at the end of a product preview section.
2. **Navigation:**  
   - On tap, navigates to a dedicated screen showing all items in the relevant context (category, search, etc.).
3. **Layout:**  
   - Supports both grid and list layouts, adapting to user preference or device type.

### Filter

1. **Entry Point:**  
   - Appears as a button in the app bar or above the product list/grid.
2. **Interaction:**  
   - On tap, opens a modal bottom sheet or side drawer with filter options.
3. **Options:**  
   - Includes toggles, sliders, checkboxes, and dropdowns for various attributes.
4. **Apply/Reset:**  
   - Users can apply filters to update the product list or reset to default.

---

## State Management

- **Provider/BLoC:**  
  - `ProductListProvider` or `ProductBloc` manages product data, filter state, and loading status.
- **Filter State:**  
  - Maintains selected filters, supports serialization for API requests.
- **See All State:**  
  - Handles pagination, loading, and error states for large datasets.

---

## API & Data Layer

- **Data Fetching:**  
  - Products are fetched from a repository, which abstracts API or local data source.
- **Filtering:**  
  - Filters are sent as query parameters to the backend or applied locally.
- **Pagination:**  
  - "See All" supports infinite scroll or paginated loading for performance.

---

## Filtering Logic

- **Attribute Mapping:**  
  - Each filter option maps to a product attribute (e.g., `price`, `brand`, `inStock`).
- **Backend/Local Filtering:**  
  - Filters are applied server-side when possible; fallback to local filtering for cached data.
- **Combinatorial Logic:**  
  - Supports multiple filters at once (e.g., price range + brand + rating).

**Example Filter State:**
```dart
class ProductFilter {
  final RangeValues priceRange;
  final Set<String> brands;
  final double minRating;
  final bool inStockOnly;
  // ...other fields
}
```

---

## See All Logic

- **Context Awareness:**  
  - "See All" adapts to the current context (e.g., category, search, recommendations).
- **Navigation:**  
  - Uses named routes or Navigator for deep linking.
- **State Restoration:**  
  - Remembers scroll position and applied filters when navigating back.

---

## Responsiveness & Adaptivity

- **Grid/List Toggle:**  
  - Users can switch between grid and list views; shimmer loading adapts accordingly.
- **Adaptive Layouts:**  
  - Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and web.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Buttons and filters are accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation.

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  - For filter logic, state management, and data fetching.
- **Widget Tests:**  
  - For UI components like `SeeAllButton`, `FilterSheet`, and product lists.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - For end-to-end flows (applying filters, navigating to "See All", etc.).

---

## Extensibility & Customization

- **Adding New Filters:**  
  - Extend the `ProductFilter` model and update the filter sheet UI.
- **Custom Filter Widgets:**  
  - Support for custom filter types (e.g., color swatches, sliders).
- **Localization:**  
  - All labels and options are localizable.

---

## Security & Performance

- **Input Validation:**  
  - All filter inputs are validated before use.
- **Efficient Data Fetching:**  
  - Uses pagination and caching to minimize API calls.
- **Sensitive Data:**  
  - No sensitive user data is exposed in filter or see all requests.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Filters Not Applying:**  
  - Ensure filter state is correctly serialized and sent to the backend.
- **See All Not Loading:**  
  - Check pagination logic and API response handling.
- **UI Not Updating:**  
  - Verify Provider/BLoC is notifying listeners on state change.

---

## Changelog & Maintenance

- **Versioning:**  
  - Document changes to filter options and see all logic.
- **Deprecation:**  
  - Mark deprecated filters or layouts in the documentation.
- **Contribution:**  
  - Guidelines for adding new filters or customizing see all behavior.

## Example Usage

```dart
// See All Button
SeeAllButton(
  onTap: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/see-all', arguments: category),
);

// Filter Button
FilterButton(
  onTap: () => showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (_) => FilterSheet(
      initialFilter: provider.currentFilter,
      onApply: provider.applyFilter,
    ),
  ),
);

// Applying Filters in Provider
void applyFilter(ProductFilter filter) {
  _currentFilter = filter;
  fetchProducts();
  notifyListeners();
}
```
